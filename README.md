# World Simulation with 3 Creatures PLANISIUSS 
---

### Overview

This Python project was created as part of the **Programming Exam** for the **BSc in Artificial Intelligence at Pavia-Milano University (2023)**. The project simulates a world inhabited by three types of creatures: **Vegetobs, Carviz, and Erbasts**. Each type of creature follows specific rules for survival, reproduction, and interaction with the environment. The simulation tracks population dynamics over time, and includes graphical plots to visualize the changes.

The main file to run is ``` graphic_portion.py ```, which generates the graphical representation of the simulation. The ``` NUMCELL ``` allows users to easily adjust the grid size of the world, offering flexibility in how the simulation environment is structured.

Additionally, a comprehensive report is provided in the ```.pdf``` file, explaining the project in detail, including the underlying algorithms, rules governing each creature, and the design decisions made throughout the development process.
